﻿Interim Injunction Order granted by the High Court against promotion, encouragement and incitement of the use or threat of violence via internet-based platform or medium The Secretary for Justice as guardian of the public interest applied to the Court yesterday (October 31) for an ex parte injunction (High Court Intended Action 202or 2019) to restrain persons from unlawfully and wilfully conducting themselves in any of the following acts :- (a) Wilfully disseminating, circulating, publishing or re-publishing on any internet-based platform or medium (including but not limited to LIHKG and Telegram) any material or information that promotes, encourages or incites the use or threat of violence, intended or likely to cause :- (i) bodily injury to any person unlawfully within Hong Kong; or (ii) damage to any property unlawfully within Hong Kong. (b) Assisting, causing, counselling, procuring, instigating, inciting, aiding, abetting or authorizing others to commit any of the aforesaid acts or participate in any of the aforesaid acts. Since this June, there have been numerous instances of violent protests and vandalising acts in many districts of Hong Kong including but not limited to criminal damage to property, assaults of the person, riots and arson.

Such acts have seriously breached public peace, and posed a grave and genuine danger to the police and members of the public. The Secretary for Justice seeks this injunctive order to restrain such abusive use of internet-based platform or medium. The Court has granted an interim injunction which will remain in force up to and including Friday, 15 November 2019 at 10:30 a.m..

Terms on Interim Injunction Order granted by the High Court to restrain doxxing and harassment against police officers and their families clarified The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) today (November 8) applied to the High Court to clarify the terms of the interim injunction order granted on October 25, 2019 (with amendments dated October 28 and October 31 in 2019). In today’s judgment, the Court recognised that there is a serious and prevalent issue of doxxing particularly against police officers and their families (including young children). The Court also acknowledged that the Secretary for Justice is properly bringing this action as guardian of public interest. It was common ground between the parties that: 1.    Acts of doxxing of police officers and their family members are not to be supported or condoned. HKJA agrees that there are serious issues of doxxing, and that it does not seek to prevent police officers from seeking legal protection of the Court. 2.    Whilst the injunction is not intended to stifle genuine and lawful journalistic activities, a journalist who engages in unlawful conduct amounting to public nuisance, harassment andor or intimidation would come within the terms of the injunction. We reiterate that the injunction is not intended to target lawful and legitimate journalistic activities, and under the injunction granted by the Court today, journalists can continue to engage in such lawful and legitimate journalistic activities. However, the injunction remains applicable in prohibiting acts beyond these boundaries. As emphasised by the Court in today’s judgment, freedom of expression is not absolute and is subject to legitimate restrictions. It is therefore important to refrain from acts which are prohibited by Court orders, including the various injunction orders (whether interim or final). Relevantly, unlawful disclosure of personal data intended or likely to intimidate, molest, harass, threaten or pester any police officer(s) and their families without their consent, whether by media or otherwise, would remain to be prohibited by the injunction. Anyone who violates an injunction order may be subject to contempt of court and will be liable to a custodial sentence or be fined if held guilty of such contempt.
